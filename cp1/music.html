            <h2>My World of Music</h2>
            <p>
                Music acts as a sort of motivator and emotional boost for me. 
                Though I don't need music to regulate my emotions necessarily, 
                I find great joy in playing my favorite artists, even if I was 
                previously in a bad mood. My favorite times to listen to music 
                are when I'm cooking, playing games, doing homework (though I 
                play more chill music in this case), and I am even guilty of 
                listening to and singing along to songs in the shower.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, I enjoy music one can dance to (though I don't 
                physically dance, I find myself humming along or tapping my 
                body, a more metaphorical type of dancing). My favorite genre 
                of music is pop, though within this genre I enjoy a mix of pop 
                with disco, funk, and R&B. Currently, my favorite artists are 
                Jessie Ware, Kylie Minogue, Carly Rae Jepsen (I was a top 0.005%
                CRJ listener on Spotify Wrapped in 2023!), and Rina Sawayama,
                though I find my Spotify playlists filled with many different 
                artists.
