            <h2>My World of Cooking</h2>
            <p>
                Since childhood, I've always observed how my parents cooked
                traditional Vietnamese dishes: the way they would toss the 
                ingredients together, the delightful smell that would fill the 
                house, and especially the unforgettable taste! From these 
                observations and from my parents' teachings, I developed a love 
                for cooking (especially traditional Vietnamese dishes) and was 
                always excited to make them with my own little twists. Now that 
                I am in college out-of-state, I may no longer have a physical 
                connection to home, but through the opportunity to cook these 
                dishes, I maintain a sort of spiritual connection to home.

                Pictured below is an intermediate progress photo of me making 
                Nem Nướng Cuốn, a traditional Vietnamese pork spring roll dish.
                Though not perfect, I am proud of the progress I have made as a
                home cook, and will continue to pursue cooking as a hobby.
